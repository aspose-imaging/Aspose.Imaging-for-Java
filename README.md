# Java API for Image Processing

It is a [standalone Imaging API](https://products.aspose.com/imaging/java) consists of Java routines that enable your Java applications to draw as well as perform basic to advanced level processing of raster & vector images.

Aspose.Imaging for Java offers robust image compression and high processing speed through native byte access and a range of efficient algorithms. It not only manipulate, export and convert images but also lets you dynamically draw objects using pixel manipulation and Graphics Path.

## Get Started with Aspose.Imaging for Java

Aspose hosts all Java APIs at the [Aspose Repository](https://repository.aspose.com/webapp/#/artifacts/browse/tree/General/repo/com/aspose/aspose-imaging). You can easily use Aspose.BarCode for Java API directly in your Maven projects with simple configurations. For the detailed instructions please visit [Installing Aspose.Imaging for Java from Maven Repository](https://docs.aspose.com/display/imagingjava/Installation#Installation-InstallingAspose.ImagingforJavafromMavenRepository) documentation page.

## Crop EMF Image by Rectangle using Java

```java
MetafileImage metaImage = (MetafileImage) Image.load(dataDir + "Picture1.emf");

// Create an instance of Rectangle class with desired size
Rectangle rectangle = new Rectangle(10, 10, 100, 100);

// Perform the crop operation on object of Rectangle class
metaImage.crop(rectangle);

// Save the result in PNG format
metaImage.save(dataDir + "CropbyRectangle_out.png", new PngOptions());
```
